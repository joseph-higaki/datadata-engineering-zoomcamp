# Docker

## Running Docker 
I don't have Docker installed in my Win local laptop
So will try to run docker from the codespace 

After I get to setup a postgre docker image, then I can try to run that image in a locally hosted docker 

```bash
docker info 
```
![docker info](../../_resources/01%2002%20docker%20info%20codebase.png)

Run a 
```
docker build -f ProductionDockerfile -t test-python
```
